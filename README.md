# Childhood-memories
This dataset includes this particular study group's items of importance from their childhood. It is an important dataset because it conserves important historical artefacts that have the possibility to be lost or broken since most of the items are physical things.
All data is included in the .xlsx-file - including the description of the meanings of categories. 
The data was collected in the early autumn of 2023.
Includes data from Rasmus Eiby Andersen, Hanne Kolind-Sørensen, Daniel Dyrendal Rosenlund Wickstrøm and Poul Hjort Pedersen.
